# LettrBlack Public Preview Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds public preview functionality to the LettrBlack app, allowing users to browse the platform without requiring authentication while restricting interactive features to authenticated users only.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Authentication Context (`client/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Created a new `AuthContext` to manage authentication state globally
- Provides `useAuth` hook with authentication status and user data
- Includes `requireAuth` function to protect actions that need authentication
- Manages the sign-in modal state

### 2. Sign-In Modal (`client/components/SignInModal.tsx`)
- Beautiful modal that appears when unauthenticated users try to access protected features
- Shows available features with icons and descriptions
- Provides direct links to sign-in and sign-up pages
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

### 3. Updated App Structure (`client/App.tsx`)
- Removed `AuthWrapper` that previously blocked all routes
- All routes are now publicly accessible
- Added `AuthProvider` and `SignInModal` to the app structure
- Authentication restrictions are now handled at the component level

### 4. Updated Layout (`client/components/Layout.tsx`)
- Shows "Sign In / Sign Up" buttons in the top navigation for unauthenticated users
- Shows user profile and notifications for authenticated users
- Maintains the same sidebar navigation for all users

### 5. Updated Pages

#### Index Page (`client/pages/Index.tsx`)
- Shows welcome message for both authenticated and unauthenticated users
- XP progress card only visible to authenticated users
- Quick action cards work for all users but require authentication for navigation
- Recent activity section shows different content based on authentication status

#### LettrPlay Page (`client/pages/LettrPlay.tsx`)
- Public preview of all games with descriptions and features
- "Play Now" buttons require authentication
- Shows sign-in buttons for unauthenticated users
- XP display only for authenticated users

#### Groups Page (`client/pages/Groups.tsx`)
- Public preview of all study groups
- Create group and manage buttons only for authenticated users
- Join buttons show "Sign In to Join" for unauthenticated users
- Floating action button only visible to authenticated users

## Features Available to Unauthenticated Users

### Public Preview Features:
- ✅ Browse homepage and see app overview
- ✅ View all study groups and their details
- ✅ Browse LettrPlay games and read descriptions
- ✅ View leaderboards and marketplace
- ✅ Navigate through all pages
- ✅ See the app's design and features

### Restricted Features (Require Authentication):
- ❌ Joining or creating study groups
- ❌ Posting or chatting in groups
- ❌ Playing LettrPlay games
- ❌ Saving progress or profile updates
- ❌ Accessing LetterAI assistant
- ❌ Viewing personal XP and progress
- ❌ Managing notifications

## User Experience Flow

1. **First Visit**: Users see the homepage with public content and "Sign In / Sign Up" buttons
2. **Browsing**: Users can explore all sections of the app freely
3. **Interaction Attempt**: When clicking any restricted action, the sign-in modal appears
4. **Authentication**: Users can choose to sign in or create an account
5. **Full Access**: After authentication, users have access to all features

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Hook Usage:
```typescript
const { user, isAuthenticated, requireAuth } = useAuth();

// For protected actions:
const handleProtectedAction = () => {
  requireAuth(() => {
    // This code only runs if user is authenticated
    performAction();
  });
};
```

### Conditional Rendering:
```typescript
{isAuthenticated ? (
  <AuthenticatedUserContent />
) : (
  <PublicUserContent />
)}
```

## Benefits

1. **Better User Acquisition**: Users can see the app's value before signing up
2. **Reduced Friction**: No immediate authentication barrier
3. **Improved Conversion**: Users understand what they're signing up for
4. **Maintained Security**: Sensitive actions still require authentication
5. **Smooth UX**: Seamless transition from preview to full access

## Files Modified

- `client/App.tsx` - Removed AuthWrapper, added AuthProvider
- `client/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - New authentication context
- `client/components/SignInModal.tsx` - New sign-in modal component
- `client/components/Layout.tsx` - Updated navigation for public access
- `client/pages/Index.tsx` - Updated for public preview
- `client/pages/LettrPlay.tsx` - Updated for public preview
- `client/pages/Groups.tsx` - Updated for public preview

## Notes

- The implementation maintains all existing functionality for authenticated users
- The sign-in modal provides a smooth user experience without page redirects
- All authentication state is managed centrally through the AuthContext
- The UI remains consistent and professional for both user types
